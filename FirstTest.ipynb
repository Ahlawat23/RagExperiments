      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Early life Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in the town Akebono-cho in Hongō, Tokyo City,\n",
      "Empire of Japan, the second of four sons. His father, Katsuji Miyazaki (born 1915), was the director\n",
      "of Miyazaki Airplane, his brother's company, which manufactured rudders for fighter planes during\n",
      "World War II. The business allowed his family to remain affluent during Miyazaki's early life.\n",
      "Miyazaki's father enjoyed purchasing paintings and demonstrating them to guests, but otherwise had\n",
      "little known artistic understanding. He was in the Imperial Japanese Army around 1940, discharged\n",
      "and lectured about disloyalty after declaring to his commanding officer that he wished not to fight\n",
      "because of his wife and young child. According to Miyazaki, his father often told him about his\n",
      "exploits, claiming he continued to attend nightclubs after turning 70. Katsuji Miyazaki died on\n",
      "March 18, 1993. After his death, Miyazaki felt he had often looked at his father negatively and that\n",
      "he had never said anything \"lofty or inspiring\". He regretted not having a serious discussion with\n",
      "his father, and felt he had inherited his \"anarchistic feelings and his lack of concern about\n",
      "embracing contradictions\".\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Some of Miyazaki's earliest memories are of \"bombed-out cities\". In 1944, when he was three years\n",
      "old, Miyazaki's family evacuated to Utsunomiya. After the bombing of Utsunomiya in July 1945, he and\n",
      "his family evacuated to Kanuma. The bombing left a lasting impression on Miyazaki, then aged four.\n",
      "As a child, Miyazaki suffered from digestive problems, and was told he would not live beyond 20,\n",
      "making him feel like an outcast; he considered himself \"clumsy and weak\", protected at school by his\n",
      "older brother. From 1947 to 1955, Miyazaki's mother Yoshiko suffered from spinal tuberculosis; she\n",
      "spent the first few years in hospital before being nursed from home, forcing Miyazaki and his\n",
      "siblings to take over domestic duties. Yoshiko was frugal, and described as a strict, intellectual\n",
      "woman who regularly questioned \"socially accepted norms\". She was closest with Miyazaki, and had a\n",
      "strong influence on him and his later work. Yoshiko Miyazaki died in July 1983 at the age of 72.\n",
      "Miyazaki began school as an evacuee in 1947, at an elementary school in Utsunomiya, completing the\n",
      "first through third grades. After his family moved back to Suginami-ku in 1950, Miyazaki completed\n",
      "the fourth grade at Ōmiya Elementary School, and fifth grade at Eifuku Elementary School, which was\n",
      "newly established after splitting off from Ōmiya Elementary. After graduating from Eifuku as part of\n",
      "the first graduating class, he attended Ōmiya Junior High School. He aspired to become a manga\n",
      "artist, but discovered he could not draw people; instead, he drew planes, tanks, and battleships for\n",
      "several years. Miyazaki was influenced by several manga artists, such as Tetsuji Fukushima, Soji\n",
      "Yamakawa and Osamu Tezuka. Miyazaki destroyed much of his early work, believing it was \"bad form\" to\n",
      "copy Tezuka's style as it was hindering his own development as an artist. He preferred to see\n",
      "artists like Tezuka as fellow artists rather than idols to worship. Around this time, Miyazaki often\n",
      "saw movies with his father, who was an avid moviegoer; memorable films for Miyazaki include Meshi\n",
      "(1951) and Tasogare Sakaba (1955). After graduating from Ōmiya Junior High, Miyazaki attended\n",
      "Toyotama High School. During his third and final year, Miyazaki's interest in animation was sparked\n",
      "by Panda and the Magic Serpent (1958), Japan's first feature-length animated film in color; he had\n",
      "sneaked out to watch the film instead of studying for his entrance exams. Miyazaki later recounted\n",
      "that, falling in love with its heroine, the film moved him to tears and left a profound impression,\n",
      "prompting him to create work true to his own feelings instead of imitating popular trends; he wrote\n",
      "the film's \"pure, earnest world\" promoted a side of him that \"yearned desperately to affirm the\n",
      "world rather than negate it\". After graduating from Toyotama, Miyazaki attended Gakushuin University\n",
      "in the department of political economy, majoring in Japanese Industrial Theory; he considered\n",
      "himself a poor student as he instead focused on art. He joined the \"Children's Literature Research\n",
      "Club\", the \"closest thing back then to a comics club\"; he was sometimes the sole member of the club.\n",
      "In his free time, Miyazaki would visit his art teacher from middle school and sketch in his studio,\n",
      "where the two would drink and \"talk about politics, life, all sorts of things\". Around this time, he\n",
      "also drew manga; he never completed any stories, but accumulated thousands of pages of the\n",
      "beginnings of stories. He also frequently approached manga publishers to license their stories. In\n",
      "1960, Miyazaki was a bystander during the Anpo protests, having developed an interest after seeing\n",
      "photographs in Asahi Graph; by that point, he was too late to participate in the demonstrations.\n",
      "Miyazaki graduated from Gakushuin in 1963 with degrees in political science and economics.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Career Early career In 1963, Miyazaki was employed at Toei Doga; this was the last year the company\n",
      "hired regularly. He began renting a four-and-a-half tatami (7.4 m2; 80 sq ft) apartment in Nerima,\n",
      "Tokyo, near Toei's studio; the rent was ¥6,000, while his salary at Toei was ¥19,500. Miyazaki\n",
      "worked as an inbetween artist on the theatrical feature films Doggie March (1963) and Gulliver's\n",
      "Travels Beyond the Moon (1965) and the television anime Wolf Boy Ken (1963). His proposed changes to\n",
      "the ending of Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon were accepted by its director; he was uncredited\n",
      "but his work was praised. Miyazaki found inbetween art unsatisfying and wanted to work on more\n",
      "expressive designs. He was a leader in a labor dispute soon after his arrival at Toei, and became\n",
      "chief secretary of its labor union in 1964; its vice-chairman was Isao Takahata, with whom Miyazaki\n",
      "would form a lifelong collaboration and friendship. Around this time, Miyazaki questioned his career\n",
      "choice and considered leaving the industry; a screening of The Snow Queen in 1964 moved him,\n",
      "prompting him to continue working \"with renewed determination\". During production of the anime\n",
      "series Shōnen Ninja Kaze no Fujimaru (1964–1965), Miyazaki moved from inbetween art to key\n",
      "animation, and worked in the latter role on two episodes of Sally the Witch (1966–1968) and several\n",
      "of Hustle Punch (1965–1966) and Rainbow Sentai Robin (1966–1967). Concerned that opportunities to\n",
      "work on creative projects and feature films would become scarce following an increase in animated\n",
      "television, Miyazaki volunteered in 1964 to work on the film The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of\n",
      "the Sun (1968); he was chief animator, concept artist, and scene designer, and was credited as\n",
      "\"scene designer\" to reflect his role. On the film, he worked closely with his mentor, Yasuo Ōtsuka,\n",
      "whose approach to animation profoundly influenced Miyazaki's work. Directed by Takahata, the film\n",
      "was highly praised, and deemed a pivotal work in the evolution of animation, though its limited\n",
      "release and minimal promotion led to a disappointing box office result, among Toei Animation's\n",
      "worst, which threatened the studio financially. Miyazaki moved to a residence in Higashimurayama\n",
      "after his wedding in October 1965, to Ōizumigakuenchō after the birth of his second son in April\n",
      "1969, and to Tokorozawa in 1970. Miyazaki provided key animation for The Wonderful World of Puss 'n\n",
      "Boots (1969), directed by Kimio Yabuki. He created a 12-chapter manga series as a promotional tie-in\n",
      "for the film; the series ran in the Sunday edition of Tokyo Shimbun from January to March 1969.\n",
      "Miyazaki later proposed scenes in the screenplay for Flying Phantom Ship (1969) in which military\n",
      "tanks would cause mass hysteria in downtown Tokyo, and was hired to storyboard and animate the\n",
      "scenes. Beginning a shift towards slow-paced productions featuring mostly female protagonists, he\n",
      "provided key animation for Moomin (1969), two episodes of Himitsu no Akko-chan (1969–1970), and one\n",
      "episode of Sarutobi Ecchan (1971), and was organizer and key animator for Ali Baba and the Forty\n",
      "Thieves (1971). Under the pseudonym Akitsu Saburō (秋津 三朗), Miyazaki wrote and illustrated the manga\n",
      "People of the Desert, published in 26 installments between September 1969 and March 1970 in Boys and\n",
      "Girls Newspaper (少年少女新聞, Shōnen shōjo shinbun). He was influenced by illustrated stories such as\n",
      "Fukushima's Evil Lord of the Desert (沙漠の魔王, Sabaku no maō). In 1971, Miyazaki developed structure,\n",
      "characters, and designs for Hiroshi Ikeda's adaptation of Animal Treasure Island, providing key\n",

      "in 1972 and 1973, with Takahata as director and Ōtsuka as animation director. Their choice of pandas\n",
      "was inspired by the panda craze in Japan at the time. Miyazaki drew storyboards for the first\n",
